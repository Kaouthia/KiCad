# KiCad Symbols, Footprints and 3D Models

There's no full project here. It's just a place to store all of the custom schematics and footprints I've created in KiCad while creating my circuits.

These symbols and footpringts have occasionally been adapted from symbols and footprints distributed with KiCad. Most of them, I've created them from scratch using either the datasheets or by physically measuring with a set of callipers. All footprints have been printed to confirm physical accuracy against actual components.
